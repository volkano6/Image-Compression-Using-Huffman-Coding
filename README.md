# Image-Compression-Using-Huffman-Coding

<h3> DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT </h3>
  <p>In this project, we will compress an image by using the Huffman method,
     save the compressed file, and compress the image from the compressed 
     file by developing a Python program. Input image of the program is an
